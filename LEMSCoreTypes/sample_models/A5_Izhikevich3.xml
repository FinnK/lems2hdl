RS (d is 8 in original paper by Izhikevich)
RS (regular spiking)
neurons are the most typical neurons in the
cortex. When presented with a prolonged stimulus (injected step
of dc-current in Fig. 2RS, bottom) the neurons fire a few spikes
with short interspike period and then the period increases. This is
called the spike frequency adaptation. Increasing the strength of
the injected dc-current increases the interspike frequency, though
it never becomes too fast because of large spike-afterhyperpolar-
izations. In the model, this corresponds to
c = -65mV (deep voltage reset) and d=8 (large after-spike jump of u)
