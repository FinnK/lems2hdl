IB (intrinsically bursting)
neurons fire a stereotypical burst of
spikes followed by repetitive single spikes (Fig. 2IB). In the
model, this corresponds to c= -55mV (high voltage reset)
and d=4(large after-spike jump of u). During the initial burst,
variable u builds up and eventually switches the dynamics from
bursting to spiking
